##HOW TO GET AVATAR OF THE VENGEFUL MONKEY IN BTD6##
Hello world, I am Dr Zomboss 2.0 and today I will be teaching you guys how to get the most overpowered tower in the entire BT6 game, the Avatar of the vengeful monkey. It is a bit complicated but when you get it, it will be VERY COOL, so try your best!
Step 1: Get the magic monkey knowledge "There can only be one" and apply it in a gamemode that is not sandbox or C.H.I.M.P.S..
Step 2: Get a plazma blast(3xx) super monkey.
Step 3: Sacrifice $50,000 on each of the 3 of the 4 tower types(primary, military, magic or support) by upgrading the super monkey to Sun temple(4xx) with the other towers close to it.
Step 4: Get a Legend of the night(xx5 super monkey) and The anti-bloon(x5x super monkey) OUTSIDE the sacifice range of True sun god.
Step 5: Sacrifice another $50,000 on each of all the 4 tower types by upgrading the Sun temple to True sun god(5xx) with the other towers close to it.
Step 6: If done correctly, the True sun god should absorb the other super monkeys and turn in to the Avatar of the vengeful monkey.
GOOD LUCK!
